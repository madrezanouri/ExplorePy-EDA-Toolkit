This end-to-end EDA toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools and reusable code modules for importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, enabling users to uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions efficiently.



# Introduction
**ExplorePy** is a comprehensive Python framework designed for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is the essential first step in any data science or machine learning project. The framework provides a step-by-step, modular, and reusable toolkit for importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing datasets.


# The goal of ExplorePy is to:

. Simplify the EDA process for analysts and data scientists.

. Save time by automating routine EDA tasks.

. Provide advanced techniques and insights to make better data-driven decisions.

. Deliver professional visualizations and detailed summary reports.



# Key Features:

. Flexible data importing (from files, APIs, databases, etc.).

. Automated data cleaning and preprocessing.

. Comprehensive analysis methods: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate.

. Stunning visualizations using both static and interactive tools.

. Automated report generation for quick sharing of insights.


# Overview of Step 1

The data importing module supports:

**1. Local File Importing:**
   
Supports multiple formats: CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, etc.

```
import pandas as pd

def import_local_file(file_path, file_type, **kwargs):
    """
    Import data from local files.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the file.
        file_type (str): Type of the file ('csv', 'excel', 'json', 'parquet', etc.).
        **kwargs: Additional arguments for specific file readers.
        
    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Loaded dataset.
    """
    if file_type == 'csv':
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, **kwargs)
    elif file_type == 'excel':
        df = pd.read_excel(file_path, **kwargs)
    elif file_type == 'json':
        df = pd.read_json(file_path, **kwargs)
    elif file_type == 'parquet':
        df = pd.read_parquet(file_path, **kwargs)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported file type: {file_type}")
    return df
```
```
# CSV
df_csv = import_local_file('data.csv', 'csv')

# Excel
df_excel = import_local_file('data.xlsx', 'excel')

# JSON
df_json = import_local_file('data.json', 'json')
  ```

 

**2. Database Integration:**
   
Import data directly from SQL databases using SQLite or SQLAlchemy.
 

**3. API Data Importing:**
   
Fetch JSON data from APIs and convert it to a DataFrame.
 

**4. Cloud Data Handling:**
   
Load data from AWS S3 buckets or other cloud services.
 

**5. Chunk Processing:**
   
Efficiently handle large datasets using chunk-based loading to avoid memory issues.
 

In this example, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to:

Import two files: one **Excel** file and one **CSV** file that have been uploaded to your GitHub repository.

Inspect the data after importing.
